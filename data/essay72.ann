AU1	582	625	I disagree to the aforementioned resolution
AU2	706	763	some of the addicts do turn over a new leaf at the prison
AU3	779	864	once they return to the society, they tend to relapse and get involved in drugs again
AU4	883	1028	in the prisons, there would not be any programs or talks that can enlighten and transform them as well as change their perspectives towards drugs
AU5	1039	1101	all the efforts of putting them behind bars are simply in vain
AU6	1112	1200	if the addicts are sent to rehabilitation centres, they will treated for their addiction
AU7	1218	1306	counselors can provide them with counseling and motivation to help them build a new life
AU8	1837	1980	with more public awareness, drug abuse can be certainly be reduced and eventually brought to a halt without having to put the addicts into jail
AU9	1343	1446	if the drug addicts are not given intense punishment, they will not change and continue to misuse drugs
AU10	1476	1555	this is mainly due to the society not accepting the prisoners as a part of them
AU11	1557	1694	If only the society or the people surrounding the addicts give them a second chance, I am sure that they will never abuse drugs once more
AU12	1696	1731	The support alone is not sufficient
AU13	1733	1829	They can also report to the concerned parties about any misuse of drugs at the residential areas
AU14	1982	2029	Everyone of us deserves a second chance in life
AU15	2042	2092	we are human beings and we learn from our mistakes
AU16	2135	2243	the society should allow leniency for people to experiment and learn, as long as it is on their own expenses
AU17	2285	2538	sending the drug addicts to rehabilitation centres acts as a beacon of hope for the affected individuals and is also a crucial step in helping them redeem their lives and rejuvenate their lost hopes for a better future rather than sending them to prison
