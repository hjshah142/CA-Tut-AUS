AU1	346	387	the major source of energy today is water
AU2	398	454	there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity
AU3	455	500	many countries still rely only on this source
AU4	502	576	To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short
AU5	584	672	during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India
AU6	674	821	If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity
AU7	834	935	it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources
AU8	947	1089	the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming
AU9	1104	1201	the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming
AU10	1220	1325	the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution
AU11	1340	1425	it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy
AU12	1427	1525	This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming
AU13	1536	1655	government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy
