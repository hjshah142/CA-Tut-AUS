AU1	290	367	the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching
AU2	369	439	it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems
AU3	448	472	it is a promising method
AU4	775	882	governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands
AU5	898	950	it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly
AU6	971	1108	pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution
AU7	1123	1250	the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours
AU8	1275	1369	several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems
AU9	1382	1548	authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars
AU10	1563	1693	temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season
AU11	1700	1764	with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems
AU12	1777	1844	cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out
AU13	1853	1892	it might not be into effect immediately
AU14	1898	1940	in the long run, it would be a wise choice
AU15	1957	2041	addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price Is not adequate
AU16	2049	2207	improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable, plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised
